										This data visualisation was published on <a href="https://video.foxbusiness.com/v/1762269010001#sp=show-clips">Fox News in Jul. 2012</a> as a contribution to the debate around the expiring Bush Tax Cuts for high income individuals. It is misleading because the y-axis is cut off. If the viewer would assume that the length of the frame is 100%, the change seems to be an increase of around 55 percentage points. However, after looking on the scale of the Y-Axis, which is placed on the left, you can see that the increase is actually around 4.6 percentage points. Moreover, the bars are filled with an aggressive colour gradient. Ultimately, if you take a larger time window (as shown in Task 3), it becomes apparent, that the new tax rate would still be very low in a historic context. FoxNews is the most watched cable news channel in the USA with 1.3 million total day viewers in 2021.
