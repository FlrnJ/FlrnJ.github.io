										This is a visualisation by Nathan Yau. You can access it <a href="https://flowingdata.com/2015/12/15/a-day-in-the-life-of-americans/">here</a>.

										This visualisation succeeds in taking very mundane information and making an intriguing story out of it. While most visualisations require a quick glance to get the key information, this one makes you pause for a while. It takes nearly 5 minutes to see the entire cycle. However, as the day is slowly unfolding, you start to discover patterns in the mass of moving bubbles which would otherwise have been difficult to show.

Another strength of this visualisation is its technical sophistication. I spend two days trying to recreate it but ultimately failed since it requires the application of three different coding languages as well as proficiency in handling various JavaScript libraries.

Finally, the visualisation is highly aesthetic and does not feel overloaded even though there is a lot of movement.
