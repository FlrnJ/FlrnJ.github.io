									<p>While clicking trough Whatsapp, I discovered the possibility to export your conversations as a .txt file. I thought that this would be a great dataset for a visualisation about me. In a first step, I coded a python programm that extracts the amount of messages I've sent on a particular day to someone. Then, I inserted that output into excel and this is what the first draft of my visualisation looked like:</p>
									<span class="image main"><img src="plots/t13-1.png" alt="" /></span>
									<p> I made a selection of chats which might have interesting patterns. Then I uploaded this data to flourish in order to make it more interactive and visually appealing. At that stage, the result looked like this:</p>
									<span class="image main"><img src="plots/t13-2.png" alt="" /></span>
									<p>At this point, I was convinced of the concept and decided to thing about the details. A problem which became quickly apparent was the daily frequency. I had so many indiviual data points, that the time series looked rather jagged and the animation took ages. To solve those issues, I coded a R-Script which took the time series data and aggregated it to a weekly frequency. Ultimately, the plot looked like this:</p>
									<span class="image main"><img src="plots/t13-3.png" alt="" /></span>
									<p>Last but not least, I realised that I needed to give some additional information about the people in the visualisation. Like that, people who don't know my contacts personally can read this plot in a meaningful way.</p>
